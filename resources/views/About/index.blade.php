    Season of Giving's aim is to lessen:
    <ul>
      <li> stress during the holiday season</li>
      <li> materialism</li>
      <li>suffering and pain through monetary donations</li>
    </ul>
    Season of Giving is concerned with numbers. How much is
    raised during the holiday season for a particular charity, reason,
    or as a whole.
    <br>
    <br>
    Season of Giving is about putting things in perspective -
    we're all in this together, and we're one greeting away from friendship
    and caring, so why don't we care straight away?
    We see pain every day in the news and in public.
    But easing pain for others isn't the first thought that
    comes to mind when shopping for a Christmas present for
    a loved one. Season of Giving aims to change that.
    <br>
    <br>
    In a world of same-day delivery and online shopping, shopping for
    others for the holidays has never been more difficult.
    Donating on behalf of others, however, brings into light what people
    really care about, same-day delivery and materialism aside.
    Donating on behalf of others makes the world a bit smaller,
    the pain and suffering and oneness a bit more tangeable.

    What will the space under your tree look like this holiday season?
